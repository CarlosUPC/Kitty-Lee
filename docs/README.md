## About the game and its context

This is a small project made by two videogame students of UPC CITM from Terrassa called Kitty Lee. Kitty Lee a side-scrolling platformer game about exploring a mysterious underground place. Our Hero is a skilled warrior cat with a red band and his name is Lee.
There is two different levels: while the first one is based on the player exploration on the cave, the second one represents the exit of this dangerous place where the player has to escape from. Lee will have to reach the end of the levels avoiding enemies which will start chasing him. Besides, Lee can collect coins that he finds into the levels.

## Main core subsystems of the game
Our game code is structured in modules. The main module (called j1App.cpp) manages all the other modules calling in a loop its respective awake, preupdate, update, postupdate, cleanup that they connect throught a base class j1Module.

Two of its modules(GUI and Entity Manager) manage a subsystem of modules that follows the same structure that the explained above with the objective to have an independent enitity and UI system that connects with the logic of the core game system.
